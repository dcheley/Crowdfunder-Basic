# Crowdfunder

A basic crowdfunding Rails app, this project began as a group assignment at Bitmaker.
Our group of 4 was tasked with updating a very basic app, adding features to a pre-existing code base. 

## Command Line Setup

1. "bundle install"
2. "rails s"
3. Open a web browser
4. Enter "localhost:3000" into the URL bar.
